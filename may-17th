"i‚Äôm not sure where to start looking for roomates‚Äî the housing megathread seems pretty dead, so i thought i‚Äôd post here. if you know anywhere else i could look, please let me know!
im aiming for a single or a large triple. im ok w both mixed gender and single gender floors.
here‚Äôs some stuff abt me and what i‚Äôm kinda looking for in a roomate:
- gender: female
- cleanlines: im pretty average &amp; i don‚Äôt care how messy you are as long as it‚Äôs in your area and doesn‚Äôt smell bad / attract bugs
- smoking / drugs: i personally do not do any. i‚Äôm cool if you do, as long as it‚Äôs not inside the dorm room
- sexuality: bisexual, i‚Äôm comfortable rooming with any sexuality.
- political views: i lean to the left, so i would not want to room with anyone extremely conservative
- guests: ok with them! i love meeting new people and i‚Äôd want to bring guests of my own. not comfy with s/o‚Äôs coming over if ur planning to do more than just talk and hang out
- sleep schedule: on weekdays i normally sleep at 10-11pm and wake up at 5-8am depending on how much hw‚Äî finals and weekends are another story üòÖ
89- fair warning: i literally cannot get up in the morning without alarms every 15 minutes. im tryna lose the habit but if you‚Äôre a light sleeper we may not be the best match
- personality: i‚Äôm pretty extroverted, so i‚Äôd prefer someone easy to talk to / not super shy who‚Äôs down to go on adventures and explore the area. i also would want someone more laid back who‚Äôs not afraid of breaking some rules (or at least who wouldn‚Äôt tell if i did!). i love hiking, backpacking, binging tv shows and kdramas, taking aimless walks, acai bowls, drawing, reading terrible romance novels, swimming at the beach, rollerblading, skiing, snowboarding, and meeting new people!
if you think we‚Äôd be a good match as friends or roomates shoot me a dm! thank u in advance incoming CS freshman looking for college nine roomates!!,2.0,1.0
"So I‚Äôve been working on my law school application lately and I hope I can take more class to boost my gpa a little before the opening of this year‚Äôs application portal. I‚Äôm fully aware that an A+ still counts as 4.0 in UC‚Äôs grading system, but it will be counted as 4.33 by the evaluation system of the law school admission council (LSAC). Anyone have any recommend classes (and hopefully easy ones)? Thanks soooo much in advance! And any additional advice about summer class or law school application will be genuinely appreciated!! ^^
Btw, for people in the same situation, here is a short list of classes I‚Äôve finished so far that may achieve an A+: COWL52, LING80K, and LGST111A w/Beaumont(you have to achieve a perfect score to get an A+ in 111A which was incredibly rare though)."Any class awarding A+ during summer and fall?
