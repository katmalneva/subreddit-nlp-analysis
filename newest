I'm teaching a new class this summer session 2 that I developed--HIS 39D: Floods, Epidemics, and Famine. The class focuses on environmental history and specifically looks at how flora, fauna, diseases, and climate impacted colonialism in places like West Africa, Mexico, Brazil, and England during the 1500s-1800s, as well as how environmental changes during the colonial period continue to impact Europe, Africa, and the Americas today.

I am really excited for the class and hoping to get a few more people enrolled--if you're at all interested, please consider signing up! Summer session 2 drop dates aren't for a couple months but class sizes are being determined this upcoming week for instructors.

Please message me with any questions! My name is Piper and my PhD research is on colonial Mexico with an emphasis on Indigenous languages (Nahuatl if you're interested!) and environmental change--I used to teach at UC Davis and CSU Sacramento before coming to UCSC and I'm excited to be teaching again after doing research for the last few months. I've included my poster for reference on GEs, day/time, etc.   Thank you :)

Hi Everyone,

I have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/ucsc) and I am really excited to share it with you.

You can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking.

Lastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking. 

Also, please dm me if you have an idea on how I can let more students know about this. And if anyone is interested in writing an article about this dm me!

Hi everyone!  
My housing group is looking for female-identified students.  
We need one student to sign a year long lease to fill a double in our townhouse from July 2022 to June 2023, and two others who would like to sublease from mid-July 2022 to mid-September 2022 (However move-in dates can be as early as July 1st, but please ask first). Rent will be $900 a month + utilities, is located near the base of campus, and 15/19/22 bus stops are right outside (3-minute walk). The townhouse comes fully furnished with couches, dining room/chairs, refrigerator/microwave, bed frame/mattress, desks, etc. It also comes with a washing machine, dryer, and dishwasher. We have a parking permit, so if you have a car, there is parking available. Unfortunately our landlady does NOT allow pets.

I'm working on an Ethnographic project about the UCSC student experience with the bus systems in Santa Cruz (METRO and Loop buses). I've made two separate google forms that are specific to the two bus systems I'm focusing on, which are the METRO buses that run all over Santa Cruz and the Loop buses that patrol around UCSC. Some questions are repeated between the two forms but answer them based on the bus system being asked. All responses will be anonymous.

There are a few free responses questions on both forms but the questions should be straightforward. You are only allowed to answer these forms once so take your time with each question. 

I'm totally open to talking more about the bus systems on this thread and invite people to have discussions about what they think about the METRO buses and Loop buses. I'll try my best to answer any clarifications about the forms or the purposes of this project and join in on the discussion as well. The purpose of these forms is to gauge general attitudes and trends within the student population of Santa Cruz. 

***Something to note about these forms:*** Please answer these forms if you are a current UCSC student as the data I'm using for this project is looking at current student experiences. For the free response questions about past experiences with these bus systems, you are free to talk about a moment that was much later than this current quarter. It will also ask you to sign in with your student email to take the forms but your email will not be recorded. 

Hopefully this answers a few initial questions and thank you for your time and consideration.

* Events you're invited to (even though you can usually attend events from any college)
* Who you graduate with (even though you can change this for a fee)
* Academic opportunities(like scholarships

I am in EOP but I wasn‚Äôt able to get housing on campus during room selection this year despite priority status. I have to take summer classes in order to stay on track with graduating on time. I can‚Äôt afford summer housing on campus even after financial aid. Currently, I am on nearly full financial aid living on campus, and I pay very little per month. With off campus, there is no financial aid and no resources; I simply can‚Äôt afford to live in santa cruz without the financial aid from living on campus. I planned to graduate in three years so I had priority status through junior year because of EOP (avoiding having to pay to live off campus), but the lack of availability of classes made it so that I‚Äôm behind in my major and can‚Äôt do that anymore unless I take summer classes. I‚Äôm feeling completely screwed over by the administration and I‚Äôm at a loss for options. Basically, I can‚Äôt find a summer sublease without knowing if I‚Äôd have to sign a lease starting mid summer for next year, but I won‚Äôt know if i have to sign a lease for next year before summer session is over because they said housing waitlist could take as long as august, but i can‚Äôt graduate in the amount of time i can afford to be here without taking those in person summer session classes. I also have to be here over summer for work. It just sucks‚Äî any advice is welcome, but to any incoming freshman who don‚Äôt come from money, know they truly do not care about educational opportunities. Am I completely fucked?

- The NIMBYs and permanent residents of Santa Cruz don't want more housing availability.
- The people protesting against building more on-campus housing are probably being manipulated into doing so by bad actors.
- If students can't/won't vote in local elections then there will always be a housing shortage.
- If people want the housing situation to improve, they need to protest in the city of Santa Cruz itself.
- Residents don't care about protests if they are sequestered at the university.
- Protesting housing at the university is preaching to the choir.

Long story short, I appealed the initial ucsc decision of rejection because I fell in love with the school. Recklessly, I was so set on attending that I didnt do deep research and am now realizing the huge cons with housing and meals and costs with UCSC. I'm not confident that all of the money will be worth it because I'm not sure what I want to do for my major.

I'm out of options and so anxious. I've scrolled through all of reddit looking for advice. 

I could transfer to a csu but chances of success are low. I could decline my SIR and go to community college while everyone else moves on and I'm still stuck in the same place. Not knowing what I want. 

I was so sure I wanted ucsc. I forgot what it was that made me tick. I know I'll miss my family and I know I'll miss my home. I dont know if I'll be able to make friends because I'm so introverted. I've been working like a dog for the school year to start only to realize what I've saved will only make 5% at most of what I need to pay this year. 

I just feel hopeless when before I was so excited. Everything has changed and I'm scared. 

My family was so excited to see me go, but I cant imagine going so confused like this. I'd just be wasting their money and throwing my energy away. 

I dont even want to do anything in science which is what my parents want for me. I just want to dance and I wish I was good enough for it to take me somewhere. But all I have is college. I'm scared I wont live up to it and I'll end up in debt and with a degree I dont want.

My parents want me to start this summer with the edge program and idk if I should or not.

What do you suggest?? Any advice?? Do you recommend I defer after all and go to a cc?? Do you think I should tough it out for a year? 

Anything will help. I'm just lost and am looking for something to clear the air even if it's just a little. 

Thank you and much love to you ‚ù§‚ù§

Tl,dr: I fell in love with ucsc, but as first loves go I'm starting to see all the red flags. Housing, meals, tuition. I wish it was more affordable and flexible for me to go to college as an undecided major. I need guidance. Should I take back my SIR and drop out before term starts in fall? Should I do summer edge?? Should I stay for a year? Let me know what you think.",UCSC,"Regretting SIR to UCSC, any suggestions?",5.0,0.67

So, I want to make this post to say the answers to some of those questions I had, as well as create space for prospective students to ask questions about being black on campus.

* The black population on campus
   * Tbh the black population can be pretty tight-knit depending on where on campus you live and what clubs you participate in. Even if you aren't close with the majority of the black people on campus, there are very few of us (currently less than 200 students) so you generally see the same black faces on campus the entire school year. At parties, you see the same faces too. Even if u live under a rock, other black people still might recognize u just from walking around.
* Black housing
   * The black housing on campus (RPAATH dorms &amp; apartments) isn't really black housing. When it comes to the dorms i will say the concentration of black people living in them is higher than what you would typically see just about anywhere else. However, a LOT of non-black people live here, so many that I'm fairly certain the majority of the population living here isn't black and yes, it has always been this way even since RPAATH was first demanded and established by the BSU on campus. The university has never held up its promise of making ABC (African, Black, Caribbean) identifying students a priority when it comes to housing, and routinely rejects black students on campus in favor of nonblack students with priority housing. Even non-black people who never applied to be in RPAATH end up here before some black students that actually applied.¬†
      * Overall RPAATH dorms are not a terrible place to live in. The small amount of black community that has been established here is nice. Living with other black people is nice. It definitely doesn't live up to the expectation when you first come in as a black student, and the non-black students that do live here can make it a hostile environment sometimes (there have been multiple instances where black students have experienced microaggressions by especially white students that live in RPAATH.
      * RPAATH Apartments are nice if you can get into them. But again, They don't prioritize ABC identifying students for RPAATH apartments either and because Stevenson apartments are incredibly popular, you will be competing with white/nonblack students for this housing as well. There have been instances where non-black students lived in RPAATH apartments while black students have been rejected.
   * I'm unsure about the ABC Housing at Rachel Carson, but I'm sure the experience is similar.
   * A lot of black students choose to live at Oakes as well. Oakes is really pretty but I'd say the biggest downside is that due to its history, it is far away from pretty much everything on campus.
* The BSU on campus 
   * The BSU on campus is active, but I definitely have my critiques of the club. There are also other places you can get involved as a black student on campus such as the AARC.¬†
* Being black on campus
   * Honestly, this university does not take care of its black students at all. The demands BSU has had for the university are completely reasonable especially considering there are so few of us on campus. The admin is incredibly greedy. The chancellor is hardly productive, she doesn't really listen to the black students on campus and in general, with all students, there is a huge disconnect between students and administration. Rather than listening to the students and funding things we need, admin pushes that money into more admin positions that don't really do anything to help the students in need.
   * Racism on campus is real, these students can be really weird and microaggressive towards you.¬†
   * The black orgs on campus work REALLY hard to make this place a decent experience for all of us, but there is only so much they can do honestly. It's difficult to organize and protest on campus because of the college structure (which was done on purpose btw), but students on campus tend to actively stand out against things anyways. Ik being political and protesting is trendy rn but tbh it's no fun at all. Organizing is tiring, we should just be able to live as students on campus, having to do all this sucks.

Key points below and full FAQ here: [https://housing.ucsc.edu/2022-23/](https://housing.ucsc.edu/2022-23/)

**Is fall housing still available for priority housing students?**

Yes! There are still spaces available for priority housing applicants. The most preferred types of housing‚Äîapartments and singles‚Äîwere selected quickly in the housing selection process. However, there are still available spaces for students with priority housing status.

**I wasn‚Äôt able to select housing during my housing selection appointment. Do I still have housing priority?**

Yes! Your priority status remains intact and you are on the [priority waitlist](https://housing.ucsc.edu/priority/waitlist.html). Your [Housing Coordinator](https://housing.ucsc.edu/contact/index.html) will do their best to find you a space matching your preferences or will offer an alternate space.

**When I logged on to make my housing selection, there were no available spaces in my community. What does this mean?**

Unfortunately, all the spaces made available for your community‚Äôs Room Selection have already been chosen by other students. Though you were unable to self-select your preferred housing assignment for fall, there are still spaces available on campus. Beginning Thursday, May 19, Housing Coordinators across campus will work collectively to confirm housing assignments for students with priority status. If a space is available at another college/community you will be offered an alternate assignment.

IDK if this applies to all areas, but I hope this helps.

TL;DR:

* If you don't get housing during room selection, you're on the Priority Waitlist.
* Priority Waitlist better than general waitlist and you'll probably get an offer of housing at some point. Don't cancel and reapply to another community or you'll be really fucked.
* Housing Coordinators will start offering housing to Priority Waitlist folks on 5/19/22, but getting an offer may take some time.
* If there isn't a spot at the area you applied to, you might be offered a spot at another housing area.
* Check your ucsc email every day for an alt offer.
* Look for off campus housing while hoping to get lucky.
* Yell at upper admin, UCOP, and (if in california) your representatives, not the housing staff people who are trying to help.
* Also check out this post which has the campus housing FAQ info (thanks u/KaylaUCSC!): [https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/usptlt/2022\_2023\_university\_housing\_faq/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/usptlt/2022_2023_university_housing_faq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

# From 9/JRL housing office sent via email to all students who applied to College Nine or John R Lewis College who were eligible for room selection on 5/18/22:

links referenced in the email:

* [https://housing.ucsc.edu/priority/waitlist.html](https://housing.ucsc.edu/priority/waitlist.html)
* [https://johnrlewis.ucsc.edu/residential-life/fall-2022.html](https://johnrlewis.ucsc.edu/residential-life/fall-2022.html) (the c9 FAQ is identical)

&amp;#x200B;

**What does being on the Priority Waitlist mean?**

* You are in the list that is first assigned as spaces open up on campus. The housing coordinator will either assign you when a space matching your preferences opens up at the community you applied to OR send you an alternate housing offer to your UCSC email.
* The waitlist is NOT numbered and assignments are not made on a first come, first serve basis. They are made on availability and roommate compatibility.
* Review ""Alternate Housing Offer"" on the Continuing Student Housing Website for more information.
* Review ""How does the waitlist for students without confirmed housing assignments work?"" on the College 9 and John R. Lewis FAQ Page.

&amp;#x200B;

**When will I get offered housing?**

* The housing coordinator will assign students throughout the summer as spaces become available. The majority of our assignments are finished by Mid-August.
* Review ""When will I hear if I got Housing? How will I know? When is the latest I will hear if I got on-campus housing?"" on the College 9 and John R. Lewis FAQ Page.

**What can I do right now?**

* Check your email every 24 hours --&gt; alternate housing offers must be accepted within 48 hours otherwise the offer is void
* Make sure your lifestyle quiz is accurate for YOU --&gt; the housing coordinator will do their best to keep roommate groups together when possible
* Add as many room types as you feel comfortable living in.
* Start looking for off-campus housing options as a precaution.
* Review ""What makes a good housing application?"" and ""What resources are available to help students look for off-campus housing?"" on the College 9 and John R. Lewis FAQ Page.

&amp;#x200B;

**Can I apply to another housing area?**

* You cannot change the community on your application. *We STRONGLY DO NOT recommend cancelling your application and reapplying to another area as that will void your priority status and place you on the general waitlist.*
* We tend to be able to offer housing to all students on the priority waitlist; we rarely are able to offer housing to all students on the general waitlist.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why did College Nine John R lewis run out of space?**

* Each housing community has a finite number of spaces available and can only make so many beds available during room selection. Until the Continuing Student Housing Application Period ends, we do not know how many students will apply to a certain community. This year a large number of applicants applied to College 9 and John R Lewis College which exceeded the number of beds available during Room Selection.

&amp;#x200B;

**Will I be offered an apartment space/a single room/etc?**

* There is limited availability of housing at UCSC and limited single and double occupancy spaces. Housing Coordinators try to assign first and second preferences whenever possible. If a student only has one preference and there is no more of that room type available, the housing coordinator will not look at that student's application until every person who has more room types requested has been placed before sending students alternate offers. If you would prefer a single, put that as your first choice. But if you wouldn't mind a triple, put that as a later preference.

&gt;If there are 10 singles (10 beds) and 10 triples (30 beds) on a floor and 50 students wanting housing, the student who requested a single AND a triple has 40 possible beds they can get assigned to. The student who ONLY wants a single has only 10 beds they can get assigned to.  
&gt;  
&gt;Once all singles have been assigned, any student who only asked for a single will not be offered a triple until everyone who has asked for a triple has been given one.

* Review ""Alternate Housing Offer"" on the Continuing Student Housing Website for more information.
* Review ""How does the waitlist for students without confirmed housing assignments work?""  and  ""What makes a good housing application?"" on the College 9 and John R. Lewis FAQ Page.

&amp;#x200B;

**What are my chances of getting housing?**

* We cannot give any students their chances of getting housing. However, there are some ways to increase your likelihood of getting housing on campus for the fall.
* Review ""What are my chances of getting housing?"" on the College 9 and John R. Lewis FAQ Page for more information.

&amp;#x200B;

**I thought housing was guaranteed?**

* As of 2020, no student is guaranteed housing due to the unpredictable nature of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. You are on the Priority Waitlist and we are usually able to offer housing to all students on the Priority Waitlist.
* Please refer to the ""Housing Priority"" page on the housing website ([https://housing.ucsc.edu/prioritygroups/index.html](https://housing.ucsc.edu/prioritygroups/index.html)) for more information.

# From Cowell/Stevenson housing office sent via email to all students who applied to Cowell or Stevenson(?) who were eligible for room selection on 5/17/22 (I bolded some stuff):

As you may have heard from your peers, the apartment and residence hall spaces that were made available for selection at Cowell have all been taken. This does not mean that you will not get housing; you have priority status for fall 2022, and we are confident that we will be able to offer you a room at UCSC.

Regarding the spaces at Cowell being taken so swiftly, please note that Cowell was one of the most sought after communities this year, with far more students applying here than spaces are available, much less apartment spaces. Many other communities are in the same situation as we are; for those who had a smaller group of students apply, they are still expecting to fill their available apartment spaces and have some students on the priority wait list after, although perhaps not as many as the communities that were the most sought after this year, like Cowell and Stevenson.

**Officially starting on May 19, we will begin the ""Priority wait list"" phase of the rooms election process; you can view more information on the priority wait list** [**here**](https://housing.ucsc.edu/priority/waitlist.html)**. This part may take some time; we will try to find you space for fall sooner rather than later, but in previous years it has been as late as mid-August before we had completely resolved the priority wait list.**

As we seek to find you a space in University housing, please consider the preferences on your application, and if a greater variety of room choices may be acceptable. **It is most likely that we will be offering residence hall triple rooms to the students on our priority wait list, from a variety of communities; these are the most common room type on campus, and the Apartments are unlikely to have many openings.** You are able to update your room choice preferences through the housing portal, although please note that you cannot change your applied for community. **If we cannot secure you a room that meets your preferences in Cowell, but have an option of a different room type or a space at a different community, we will contact you via email with an offer for this alternative space; there will be a 48 hour window to reply to secure this alternative room, so please be sure to check your UCSC email regularly.**

If you have questions or concerns regarding this situation, please feel free to ask us; we are rather overwhelmed with emails at the moment, so it may take some time for us to reply, but we will. Thank you for your patience!

# Also, for folks who logged back into the Room Selection portal after assigning housing and see that they are ineligible for room selection:

&gt;Once you have selected your housing through room selection, you are no longer eligible for room selection. We assume that students who are ineligible for room selection don't already have a housing assignment.  
&gt;  
&gt;When a student is assigned to housing, they get an automatic email titled ""UCSC Housing Assignment Confirmation"". So long as you got that email and you have not cancelled your housing, you have a confirmed assignment for housing for Fall 2022.

# Addition:

The housing offices know how fucked up housing is and are trying to help you get housing. The entry level worker who doesn't make a living wage can't fix the structural problems. They don't want students to be homeless, nor to have to change their college plans because of housing.

The UCs are funded the least when it comes to higher education in California. UCs, CSU, and Community Colleges should get the same amount of money per student (which funding isn't based on enrollment either soooo....). This is stressful, but if you want to yell at someone about it - upper admin, UCOP, and (if in California) your representatives can actually do stuff to *fix* the lack of housing.

# Addition 2: (from the 9/JRL FAQ)

On the 9/JRL FAQ it says:

&gt;If there are no spaces that match your room preferences, you will be offered a different room type.¬†This includes rooms at other housing areas including other Colleges, the Village, and the University Town Center.  
&gt;  
&gt;Alternate housing offers are made via UCSC email and require students to accept the offer within forty-eight (48) hours or the offer is void and the space will be offered to another student. Closely monitor your UCSC email and/or set up email forwarding to have your UCSC email forwarded to another account you check regularly. Students who do not respond during the allotted time, or decline an offer of housing, will be moved to the general waitlist and will no longer receive Priority Status for placement.  
&gt;  
&gt;*If you were offered alternative housing, it means we do NOT have a room at College 9 and John R Lewis College that meets your requests listed in your application.*

If I'm reading this correctly, you don't need to ask the housing coordinator if you can be considered for another housing area. From the reddit, it sounds like 9, JRL, Stevenson, Cowell, and Porter will **not** be possible for folks on the waitlist as an alternate housing area because they are full!",UCSC,Priority Waitlist FAQ (From 9/JRL's Housing Office),39.0,0.98

here‚Äôs some stuff abt me and what i‚Äôm kinda looking for in a roomate:
- gender: female
- cleanlines: im pretty average &amp; i don‚Äôt care how messy you are as long as it‚Äôs in your area and doesn‚Äôt smell bad / attract bugs
- smoking / drugs: i personally do not do any. i‚Äôm cool if you do, as long as it‚Äôs not inside the dorm room
- sexuality: bisexual, i‚Äôm comfortable rooming with any sexuality. 
- political views: i lean to the left, so i would not want to room with anyone extremely conservative
- guests: ok with them! i love meeting new people and i‚Äôd want to bring guests of my own. not comfy with s/o‚Äôs coming over if ur planning to do more than just talk and hang out 
- sleep schedule: on weekdays i normally sleep at 10-11pm and wake up at 5-8am depending on how much hw‚Äî finals and weekends are another story üòÖ
    - fair warning: i literally cannot get up in the morning without alarms every 15 minutes. im tryna lose the habit but if you‚Äôre a light sleeper we may not be the best match &lt;\3
- personality: i‚Äôm pretty extroverted, so i‚Äôd prefer someone easy to talk to / not super shy who‚Äôs down to go on adventures and explore the area. i also would want someone more laid back who‚Äôs not afraid of breaking some rules (or at least who wouldn‚Äôt tell if i did!). i love hiking, backpacking, binging tv shows and kdramas, taking aimless walks, acai bowls, drawing, reading terrible romance novels, swimming at the beach, rollerblading, skiing, snowboarding, and meeting new people!

Because of how easy the class is, I propose to Dr. Q that some balance changes should be made such that we start seeing posts here on how people are *literally dying* in the class. Anyways, there‚Äôs many aspects of the class that need to be changed, so we‚Äôll split it up into sections.

**Pipeline Changes**

-	Introducing‚Ä¶ **Negative Points!** With this new pipeline, for every failed test your score decreases by 10 (and yes it can go below 0). To put this into perspective, this means you could obtain a -340/100 on assignment 1!	
-	Less pipeline runs. Currently the pipeline runs a subset of tests on every push, with the full set being ran once a day. This too much, why should you be allowed know what your score is before turning it in? Therefore, I propose the pipeline is ran only once at 12AM on the day of the due date (Note: The current hour minute deadline on the due date is something we should keep for those who know).

**Grace Day Changes**

As if the assignments weren‚Äôt easy enough, the course also gives out 5 *‚Äùgrace days‚Äù*. Are you serious? Obviously there shouldn‚Äôt be any‚Ä¶ For those who have already used grace days, for each day you used, we‚Äôll subtract 10 points on each assignment you used them on. You don‚Äôt need them.

**Midterm Exam Changes**

-	The 1 hour given was far more than enough time and the test was also super easy. Therefore, the time should be cut in half. That might make it slightly more difficult.
-	Of course you can‚Äôt forget negative points! I mean like what else was I gonna put here??? -10 for each question wrong.

**Lecture Quiz Changes**

I mean the fact that these are ‚Äúin lecture‚Äù means they are free. Therefore, I propose that Dr. Q purposely makes his laptop have skill issues during lecture. That way, he can release the lecture quiz at 3AM for 1 hour so it runs while the whole class is asleep! You only get free points if you show determination. Sleep is for the weak.

**Assignment 5**

4 assignments isn‚Äôt enough clearly. Considering that assignment 4 deals with file atomicity with your server, we‚Äôll make this assignment actually implementing an entire OS for your server to run on. You‚Äôve been taking all of this virtualization stuff for granted, so now you‚Äôre gonna do it yourself. By the way, the time periods allotted for previous assignments were way too long. You‚Äôll only get 1 day for this one, and we‚Äôll make sure to have 200 tests on the pipeline so your score can max out at -2000/100.

**Conclusion**

I think we did a great job balancing the course! This should make it at the very least slightly harder than CSE 3. Maybe this will finally be the course that makes Troy fall off the deans list, but who really knows‚Ä¶

Merrill Apartments need 5-6 people in total (either 3 and 3 or 2 and 3), and my roommates and I have decided to stick together for the coming year. We've also found one more person, so we're in need of one or two more people to room with us next year.

We're all female and three of us are going into our junior year. The other is going into her senior year. 

Some things about us:  
\- Two of us are gamers! Valorant is what we mostly play, but I also play League and have a Switch as well that I wouldn't mind sharing.  
\- We all like to play card games -- Uno is taken very seriously in our dorm. &gt;:)  
\- We roughly share the same sleep schedule, which is sleeping sometime between 11PM - 1AM and waking up sometime between 8AM and 10AM. It would be pretty nice to room with someone with a similar sleep schedule.

If you're interested in possibly rooming with us, please comment and/or DM me! Let's get in contact and see if this will work out.

I was doing some school research for a Music Discovery project, and I found that people's (Gen Z and Millenials) main complaint is that it takes too long to find new music you love on Spotify (sifting through new playlists).

This was the core insight that led me to develop a new app to recommend + shorten music/podcasts and I'd love to test it out now. The algorithm learns and selects the best (10-20 second) parts of audio-based media content.

If you'd like I can email over a sample 1 minute playlist (just provide your favorite genre) using the shortening algorithm to test out. I can send the app when we are about to launch.

Sign up for the waitlist below if you are interested and I'd love any comments/criticisms :)

Athletics and Recreation Director Sue Harriman [asserted in Dec 2020 after announcing the layoffs](https://www.cityonahillpress.com/2020/12/10/recreational-and-p-e-instructors-face-permanent-layoffs/) ""SCUBA...and other recreational programs will not be cut and will continue to be offered in the coming academic year.""

In addition ""even with permanent staff layoffs, students will continue to pay fees associated with P.E. and recreation through Measures 32 and 64. Students pay a total of $12.50 per quarter in fees toward instruction and salaries."", so students are still paying for these courses which are no longer available. 

In the Spring Announcement the Athletics and Recreation Department states that ""local dive shops have been notified so they can prepare instruction for UCSC students with special consideration of your schedules and personal financial situations."" however before the layoffs UCSC offered SCUBA courses to students for free as a part of the above mentioned Measures.

Why are the programs you're still paying for unavailable?

Every class I took was also remote, but I think some people might find this useful still so I'll post it.

I want to post this for people who want to see what CSE upper division courses you'd take as a Computer Science student and hopefully answer some of your questions you might have about the Computer Science degree at UCSC.

This is my review about each class and professor. If you disagree with what I said, please be respectful.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fall 2020:**

|*Class*|*Professor Name*|*Rating of the Class*|*Required Course or Elective?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CSE101: Data Structures and Algorithms|Patrick Tantalo|10/10|Required|
|CSE120: Computer Architecture|Sagnik Nath|5/10|Required|

Patrick Tantalo was a really good professor. He explained all the material well and his assignments and quizzes weren't difficult at all. Workload was very manageable and I learned a lot from this class. The assignments are in C/C++. It's super important that you pick a good professor for CSE101 because that's where you learn data structures and algorithms, which will come up a lot during interviews. Highly recommend Tantalo.

This was Nath's first time teaching as a professor. He's a nice guy, but I found his lectures hard to understand and follow. His homework and exams were pretty hard at times, overall just wasn't a fun learning experience and felt this class wasn't too useful for me. Try to avoid him, but if you have to take him for CSE120, just make sure you really pay attention during lectures and attend TA office hours.

&amp;#x200B;

**Winter 2021:**

|*Class*|*Professor Name*|*Rating of the Class*|*Required Course or Elective?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CSE102: Intro to Analysis of Algorithms|David Martin|7/10|Required|
|CSE112: Comparative Programming Languages|Wesley Mackey|3/10|Required|

Martin was often unprepared to lectures and the grading of the assignments and exams were pretty harsh. I don't recommend taking him as a professor. The reason why I rate this class high was because of how useful it was. I learned a lot of new topics that would come up during interviews.

CSE112 with Mackey was boring and useless. You learn 4-5 new programming languages that you'll never use again. His lectures were boring and the assignments were pretty tough. Exams were pretty easy remotely, but I think if I took it in-person, it'd be a much harder course. Don't recommend taking any classes with Mackey in general.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spring 2021:**

|*Class*|*Professor Name*|*Rating of the Class*|*Required Course or Elective?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CSE144: Applied Machine Learning|CiHang Xie|4/10|Elective|
|CSE111: Advanced Programming|Wesley Mackey|4/10|Elective|
|STATS131: Intro to Probability Theory|David Draper|7/10|Required|

Xie's lectures and assignments were hard to understand. Lectures were kinda all over the place and the assignments were confusing. The quizzes weren't as bad, just need to look at the lecture slides. You do learn some ML topics and you code in Python. I'm not really interested in Machine Learning so I felt this class was useless for me, but if you are interested in learning ML, take CSE144 with another professor.

Mackey's CSE111 is similar to his CSE112 course, except the assignments are in C++. I only took it because there weren't any other classes open. Don't recommend taking unless you know nothing about C++ and want to learn it badly.

Draper is an easy A. He gives out the answers to all of the assignments and quizzes in his office hours so make sure to attend those. I felt the information I learned in this course was pretty useless because I don't want to do anything related to statistics at all. Might be useful for you if you plan to go into AI/ML.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summer 2021:**

|*Class*|*Professor Name*|*Rating of the Class*|*Required Course or Elective Course?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CSE183: Web Applications (changed to CSE186: Full Stack Web Development I)|David Harrison|10/10|Elective|

This was the best and most useful course I've taken here at UCSC. Harrison is a really good professor and his lectures and assignments are super clear. His exams aren't too bad as long as you pay attention during lectures and read his slides to study. I learned about many modern technologies (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL) that lots of companies use and became such a better programmer by the end of this course. This class will introduce you to web development. If you're interested in learning about it, take this class with this professor. This class was pretty difficult and time consuming, but it was worth it in the end. This course helped me land a job. HIGHLY RECOMMEND taking this course with David Harrison.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fall 2021:**

|*Class*|*Professor Name*|*Rating of the Class*|*Required Course or Elective Course?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CSE130: Principles of Computer Systems Design|Peter Alvaro|5/10|Required|
|CSE103: Computational Models|Delbert Bailey|4/10|Required|
|CSE115A: Intro to Software Engineering|Richard Jullig|9/10|Required|

Alvaro's CSE130 course was disorganized and difficult. Lectures were hard to follow at times. His exams were graded super harshly. The programming assignments were really difficult and confusing. Every programming assignment was in C. The information I learned in this class was pretty useful at least. I don't recommend Alvaro at all, take CSE130 with someone else. CSE130 is considered the hardest CSE upper division course so it's super important you take it with a really good professor.

Bailey's CSE103 lectures were pretty boring and his homework assignments weren't too hard. The exams take up most of the grade. 10% of the grade is homework and 90% of your grade is the 3 exams. You might have to take it with Bailey because there aren't too many other professors teaching CSE103 so I recommend attending office hours and paying attention during lectures. If you can, try to take it with a different professor.

I highly recommend taking CSE115A. You learn about Scrum and Agile methodologies, which many software engineers in the industry use. You also work on a project in a team throughout the whole quarter, which you can put on your resume. The projects can be almost anything you want. The class itself was super chill. The reading assignments and quizzes were easy. HIGHLY RECOMMEND taking this class, especially in the Fall quarter(I'll mention why down below).

&amp;#x200B;

**Winter 2022:**

|*Class*|*Professor Name*|*Rating of the Class*|*Required Course or Elective Course?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CSE115B: Software Design Project|Richard Jullig|10/10|Elective|
|CSE160: Intro to Computer Graphics|James Davis|9/10|Elective|

CSE115B is the continuation after CSE115A. You can only take CSE115B in the winter quarter and must complete CSE115A before taking it. In this class, you work on a project that is sponsored by an outside company. This year, there were many companies like Databricks, Dell, Keysight that sponsored projects that the students could work on. It's a really fun and useful class. There are no lectures or exams, just work on the project. It's really good to put on your resume as well. HIGHLY recommend taking this course.

CSE160 with Davis was really chill and fun. The exams weren't too difficult as long as you attended lectures. The assignments were pretty fun. I learned a lot about computer graphics as well. Overall a good class where you learn and aren't stressed out. I recommend taking it as a fun course.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spring 2022:**

|*Class*|*Professor Name*|*Rating of the Class*|*Required Course or Elective Course?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CSE115C: Software Design Project II|Richard Jullig|10/10|Elective|

CSE115C is the continuation of CSE115B. CSE115C is only offered in the Spring quarter and you must have taken CSE115B in the previous Winter quarter. You continue to work on the company-sponsored project you picked in CSE115B. CSE115B/C is similar to an internship, where you work on a project with that company and they'll help you out whenever you need help. I STRONGLY recommend taking the whole CSE115A/B/C series so you can put the projects on your resume and learn a ton of new technologies. The whole CSE115A/B/C series super chill and fun.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Thoughts:**

Overall, I felt most of these classes prepared me well for the industry. UCSC has a lot of different electives for you to choose from. There are many classes that go over topics like AI/ML, Computer Graphics, Distributed Systems, Computer Networks, Databases, and Full Stack Development.

Don't take my experiences and thoughts as facts, this is just only my opinion. In the end, your college education is what you make of it. This degree was tough so make sure you study hard and grind. I'm open to answering any questions you might have. Thank you for reading this far",UCSC,The classes I took for my Computer Science B.S. degree at UC Santa Cruz,119.0,0.98

GPA from UC Berkeley summer courses will be counted in your overall GPA of UCSC with the annotation that it was taken at Berkeley.

For some courses you might have to file a petition form with CS department by filling in the form below

[https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/current-students/policies-forms-petitions](https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/current-students/policies-forms-petitions)

**With the above process there is always a risk they might just give you unit credit and not subject credit. Also as per CS department it is best to get a pre-approval of the course whether it will be approved.** Wait times for this is about 4 weeks. Petition for CS161 is already filed to see if it can used as a capstone elective for CS, awaiting approval. So if someone else is taking CS161, approval might be faster.

Process to enroll is very simple for UC students across any campus(incl UCSC).

Just go to [summer.berkeley.edu](https://summer.berkeley.edu) and be sure to enroll as a UC campus student to get the discounted rate. You will need to give a photo of student id , or in case of newly admitted freshman/transfer you can give a screenshot of your signed SIR as a proof of being a UC student.",UCSC,Seats available in upper/lower division CS courses at UC Berkeley for UCSC students,3.0,0.6

**University Wisconsin Madison - MS in information**

Pros:

- Prestige US rank 12; World rank 17 according to CSRanking.

- Subject (MS in Information) comparatively close to Computer Science.

- More campus networking is possible since iSchool is on the main campus.


Cons:

- Job opportunity difficulties as per current students of UWM iSchool.

- No TA/RA.


**University of California, Santa Cruz, Silicon Valley Campus - MS in NLP**

Pros:

- Companies and job opportunities due to location (Silicon Valley).

- UC reputation.

- Possibility of TA.

Cons:

- US rank 35; World rank 38  according to CSRanking.

- The subject is MS in NLP and not Computer science.

- Lesser campus network since the Silicon Valley Campus campus is quite far from the main UCSC campus.


Similarities:
- Both the courses are new, with just two passed-out batches.

- Course length of 1.5 years


I want to decide which is the best option based on Quality of Education, Return on Investment, Internship, and Job Prospects. The end goal is the job!

Please help me out in the comments with your suggestions/opinions as well.

I've heard good things about the program and its faulty but I see a lot of negative things about the school and its administration (bus system, housing, etc.). I want to get a lot of experience and explore doing research. I've heard UCSC offers a lot of opportunities but am wondering if its worth dealing with the negatives? I would most likely live on campus the first year since its guaranteed and so I could get used to the school more. 

As for CSUMB I was accepted into their marine science program, however my only issue with the school is that marine science seems more like learning various technology to study marine ecosystems and not really focused on studying marine animals and their environment which is what I'm more interested in. But I wasn't sure if career wise or grad school wise its better to go broader and study marine science than marine bio. I've also heard good things about the program and I like that the classes are small. Seems like a cool school.

I've been accepted to 5/5 UC's that I applied to but I'm only really interested in Santa Cruz and Berkeley. The campuses and overall vibes are SO different between the two that it's almost impossible to compare and contrast. It's like comparing two entirely different subject matters. 

I understand that Berkeley has amazing opportunities and resources, but overall **happiness and quality of life are extremely important to me.** Straight up I can tell you that if I choose Berkeley, I will not be hustling for straight A's and I'm okay with that. I'll definitely apply myself and work hard, but it's not the end of the world for me if I'm not a perfect student. Is balance something that is attainable at UCB? I love the history of the campus and the seemingly abundant opportunities. It's so inspiring to be amongst so many intelligent people. I like the idea of attending a top university but I don't want prestige to be one of the reasons for choosing Berkeley. As a transfer student, I'll only have two years and I want them to be memorable and meaningful. My biggest concern about Berkeley is that while I would be getting a top notch education, I'd miss out on a ton of great non-academic experiences due the stressful workload.

On the other hand, Santa Cruz is really peaceful and gorgeous. While their academics are by no means on Berkeley's level, I think that they still have a really great anthro department. I feel like at UCSC I'd be able to work hard and play hard - I don't have the same fear of losing out on fun experiences due to an overwhelming workload. While the quality of life at Santa Cruz is a plus, I'd still be missing out on the world class education at Berkeley, but it wouldn't be the end of the world. It's not at all a stressful environment from what I've seen and that's pretty attractive to me. I love nature and I think that I'd enjoy having access to recreation so close to campus. My biggest fear about Santa Cruz is that while I'd have an amazing time, the academics might be slightly sub-par.

There are pro's and con's at both universities. If I'm not considering something please tell me. If anyone has any info about the anthro department at Santa Cruz, lmk! Anyways, what do you guys think? Has anyone chosen UCSC over Berkeley?",UCSC,UCSC VS UCB for anthro (Transfer Student),1.0,0.56

We are recruiting for participation in a confidential survey to identify and assess healthcare experiences of LGBTQ+ UC undergraduates when accessing UC Student Health Services. The survey is designed to be a safe and confidential way to collect data, with students having the option to disclose as little or as much information as they wish.

Additionally, this research is being conducted by a team led by queer undergraduate students to improve health services for LGBTQ+ students at UC San Diego. Input would be used to inform UC campuses on ways to better the quality of care received by LGBTQ+ people and identify additional systematic barriers. This study encourages the UC System to address its current policies and procedures in place, and to better tailor its programs and policies for undergraduate LGBTQ+ students. This study has been IRB approved by the UCSD Human Research Protection Program.

If you're already studying and hitting 505-510 my only advice would be to keep doing whatever you're doing. Honestly, if you're deep into studying already just keep grinding.

And please don't pay for any programs like Kaplan... they're just feeding off students' insecurities and telling them advice for 2-5k that's already available over at r/MCAT for free.

TLDR:

First do the free BP full exam to just get a taste of what you're actually dealing with and where you're at. You'll get rekt, but just do it. I know it's scary and seems counterintuitive but it's important to have a growth mindset anyways.

pick up rebopbebop's or miledown's anki decks and get thru it (1-2 months)

then do all of Uworld and make anki cards + do CARs Qpacks (AAMC) (1-2 months)

do 5 Altius exams while keeping up with anki + CARs Qpacks (AAMC) (1 month)

redo Uworld a second time + CARs Qpacks (AAMC) (1 month)

do the SB (AAMC) + CARs Qpacks (AAMC) + Uworld weakest subject (1 week)

do the AAMC Fls and get ur 515+

&amp;#x200B;

If you're hitting \~80% correct during ur second pass of Uworld or first pass of the SB (AAMC) it means your content is in the 515+ territory and you need to really focus on limiting your mistakes.

I'm attaching an SUA resolution I worked on with others opposing the meal plan, which also describes the meal plan and reasonings/critiques voiced by students. 

But a **tldr** is that the university is increasing the price of the plan while devaluing what you receive. The two plans simulate the 7-day and 5-day but are a point system you can use at the dining halls and cafes. If you were to exclusively use the ""Gold Slug"" plan--which replaces the 7-day--at only dining halls, you would only have **2.5 meals per day** or a day without meals. The ""Blue Slug"" plan only includes 15 meals per week and can encourage the rationing of meals. Their justification was that this was the cheapest option for students due to inflation and the food supply chain, as well as data showing that students only eat on average around 2.5 meals a day. However, this puts a financial and mental strain on students who are not the average, especially with the current inconsistency of the dining halls now. Additionally, all of this was done without student input or consent. The school should not put the weight on students as providing basic needs should be their utmost priority.

No one should have the added stress of budgeting basic needs or having to work more hours in order to pay for extra groceries, especially with the current state of transportation and the impacts of the pandemic. If you would like to voice your opinion to the administration, dining hall services and CHES staff members will be coming to the next SUA meeting (5/3) on Tuesday starting at 7:30. It will be a continued conversation from the last meeting where they presented the plan. We'll also be voting on the resolution! If you can't attend the meeting, please spread the word and have conversations with your friends, get angry. Students have a voice and we are going to utilize it as much as we can to have this basic need. thanks for reading :)

I‚Äôm in a kind of special situation so I need a really responsible and trustworthy person.

About the apartment: 
2br 1 ba ground floor with a large living room and all hardwood flooring, gas stove, an epic media center with a fireplace, everything is furnished except your room. Block from the dog park, little ceasars on the corner, down the street from the boardwalk 

Lease: July-December, might be able to extend (probably will)
Deposit: 1000, +500 for pet

Your monthly payments:
Rent: $1492.5
Pet rent: $25
Utilities (water/sewage): $30
PGE: around $50

About me: 
Female, 20yo (21 in June babyyyyy) about to be a senior in CS Game design. I am a professional dog trainer and currently train at Petsmart (yes I can get you epic discounts). I am gone frequently and work anywhere between 25-40 hours a week depending on my training schedule. Also a part-time swim instructor. I love thrifting, playing video games, and being able to talk to you about random shit from across our rooms.

I have a service dog red Siberian husky named Naya who is a total diva and makes you work to win her over. She is extremely dog friendly and would prefer if you had a dog too! She‚Äôs best friends with the other dog living here so she will be sad when she leaves. She does shed a lot so the floor often looks like snow, but I have blankets on the couch to minimize it.

Now the interesting part. I‚Äôm very into fish keeping and often rescue unwanted fish or from people who are moving. Currently I have 8 (yeah ik it‚Äôs nuts) fish tanks, some of which I have invested lots of time and money into. 

About you:
Because of my dog and fish, it is really important to me that you are respectful and responsible. While I can bring Naya with me to work occasionally, there will be days I can‚Äôt and in that case she is gonna want to hang out with you, though she is very low maintenance despite being an attention snob. My fish are also very special, and I need to be able to trust that you won‚Äôt mess with them (ik that seems weird but it happens). Rarely I will go visit my parents for a few days and I‚Äôll need you to feed them, which is super easy. In that case Naya flies with me so I won‚Äôt be leaving her.

Dm me with questions or if you‚Äôre interested so we can meet up!

I'm an International student from Tamil Nadu, India so I haven't received any scholarship except for a 5000$ per year scholarship to UCSC. I am interested in both Physics and Astrophysics, but my interest in Astro is higher.

Factors that *I* am considering or need to be considered:

1. Cost of Tuition and Living - I will be taking a loan but that doesn't mean I wanna spend the rest of my life paying back the loan, so I wanna know which one has the best cost-to-return ratio and I want the money that I'm spending on my education to be a worthy investment.
2. Undergraduate Research Opportunities - Which one has good opportunities for International students in Physics and Astrophysics?
3. Employability - For now, I'm interested in pursuing research for the rest of my life but as research doesn't provide me a lot of money, I'm planning to work in corporate for a few years to pay back my loan and have sufficient money to be happy. So, while ranking doesn't matter all that much to me, if it matters for my future employment opportunities.
4. Quality of Professors in Physics/Astrophysics and quality of Research, Teaching - While I do worry about the cost, as said in my first factor, I want an Uni that has a worthy cost-to-quality ratio out of all of these.
5. Social Life - I want colleges which aren't like socially dead, while it doesn't have to be full-on raves, streaking, Greek life, and parties, I do want a uni where I can have a reasonable social life, friendships, etc and not just talk about the next assignment due.
6. Safety - I guess it should be somewhat safe enough that I can finish my undergrad without getting stabbed to death for my Nokia phone lol
7. Scholarship/Finanacial Aid Opportunities - While I haven't received any major aid/scholarship for my 1st year, I do want to try and get some for my other years.

&amp;#x200B;

945,2022-04-24T21:57:07Z,0.0,ubd64s,t3,,1.0,"Throwaway account for anonymous reasons. I've been a long-time supporter and past employee of 11th Hour Coffee. There were things about the shop that was bothering and unsettling working there, 

1) The brothers (Owners) are always there but hardly mentally present. They do not help, even when their job permits them to (doing repairs because everything in their shop is built by them, and therefore dysfunctional 80% of the time; helping during a rush when understaffed; cannot give any sense of direction when their help is needed)

2) They view their staff as hired friends rather than people they pay to keep their business afloat. When they decide they want to be treated as owners, they are hostile and rude without any warning. Could be night and day with them at times

With this said, my plea to my fellow students isn't to work there because of them, they have space to grow if held accountable (and cornered to address their accountability if necessary) but rather because of their General Manager. Here is the list of things he has done that is immoral and bordering illegal.

1) Disrespecting set schedules provided by staff, then expressing anger towards said staff when told they can't work said shift. 

2) Has openly made fun of, and shames a staff member for being autistic to other staff members (Me personally, and I'm sure I'm not the only one)

3) Hires a bunch of already trained male baristas and has allowed them to bully and overpower existing female staff members (giving them shift leader shifts and giving them permission to tell other staff what to do without training them first. It may seem like a stupid reason, but anyone who has worked in a fast-paced environment or specifically coffee, knows how demeaning and intentional this feels)

4) Does not train staff. Expects other staff to train them for him

5) This week TWO staff members tested positive for covid and exposed many other staff and customers and he did not tell those staff members they were exposed. They had to find out from their covid-positive coworkers. this isn't the first time it has happened. Prior was 6 months ago, the Covid-positive staff member infected two more staff members then, and nothing was addressed. 

6) When dealing with personal issues, or work-related issues, he can become verbally aggressive

7) disrespects pronouns and makes fun of they/them pronouns in front of said non-binary person. 

I know there are many places in Santa Cruz with similar issues or far worse conditions such as Lulu Carpenters. My only reason to relay this information here is that my past coworkers are expressing to me that conditions are only getting worse. I've included a list below of businesses that respect employees much more below. Capitalism is a bloodthirsty beast and the representatives of 11th Hour do not respect their employees for the work they provide. 

Best businesses to work for under, please include more or exclude them if you experienced them differently!

\-Curves (Aptos): Run by a super wonderful mom, is a female-based gym with a much older clientele. Is slow and a bit boring at times but you will always be treated with respect by coworkers and the owner, and build some amazing connections

\-Cat and Cloud: There have been issues with a certain manager I have heard, but is a fun environment and is a fast-growing popular coffee shop if you choose that you want to jumpstart a coffee career or successful hobby 

\-Cisco: If you want to go into technical engineering, they literally pay you to finish your degree and look for new and fresh minds

\-Lenz Arts: Worked here years ago and had a creepy coworker, but the owner was awkward but nice. I hope that coworker is gone, the only reason I left. 

\-REI: Gives an amazing discount. Is corporate so can suck in that aspect, but at least everyone has something in common (basically anything outdoors). Opportunities for promotion and to learn new things

\-Santa Cruz Bikes: never worked here so leave reviews below, BUT offers amazing discounts, healthcare, on-the-job provided food, and pet insurance!

Add more below! Nothing will change in Santa Cruz unless we address it and confront it :) even minor things can be relatively big for someone else. Stay kind &lt;3",UCSC,"Fellow UCSC working students, don't work (or possibly shop) at the 11th hour coffee",1.0,1.0

What classes should I take particular interest in given my interest in IT?

What clubs/ec's do you recommend or useful sources to find good clubs/study groups?

I was offered a work/study program while my current employer has also offered me a remote plan where I can be in a sort of help desk role, although I would occasionally have to travel (San Jose area). Which role would best suit a cs workload/schedule?

I want to keep my car, but should I. 

Professor's you recommend? How to make yourself stand out to professors, and not just academically.

Good niche coding languages to learn? I have a fairly good grasp of Java (not niche ik) already but I do have an interest in learning languages such as COBOL. 

Math is really hard for me, tips or sources on how to improve in complicated subjects such as calc? Also how to properly study, I usually just purge myself all night right before a test but that isn't the best for learning.
