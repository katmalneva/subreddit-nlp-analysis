8,UCSC,"17 Months Later: After Laying Off Instructors, UCSC Has No Recreational Scuba Classes Offered, Despite Promising Courses Would Be Available in 2021","Instead Athletics and Recreation has posted [this announcement](https://recreation.ucsc.edu/news/scuba-update-w22.html) claiming that classes are unable to be offered due to ""the Covid-19 pandemic...human resource processes, supply chain logistics, dive locker inspection approvals, and required staff certifications"".

Athletics and Recreation Director Sue Harriman [asserted in Dec 2020 after announcing the layoffs](https://www.cityonahillpress.com/2020/12/10/recreational-and-p-e-instructors-face-permanent-layoffs/) ""SCUBA...and other recreational programs will not be cut and will continue to be offered in the coming academic year.""

In addition ""even with permanent staff layoffs, students will continue to pay fees associated with P.E. and recreation through Measures 32 and 64. Students pay a total of $12.50 per quarter in fees toward instruction and salaries."", so students are still paying for these courses which are no longer available. 

In the Spring Announcement the Athletics and Recreation Department states that ""local dive shops have been notified so they can prepare instruction for UCSC students with special consideration of your schedules and personal financial situations."" however before the layoffs UCSC offered SCUBA courses to students for free as a part of the above mentioned Measures.

Why are the programs you're still paying for unavailable? UCSC had one of the best scuba instruction programs in the state and now has no program, instead is forcing students to pay for outside instruction.",1.0,1.0,t3
