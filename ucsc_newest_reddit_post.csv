0,UCSC,"17 Months Later: After Laying Off Instructors, UCSC Has No Recreational Scuba Classes Offered, Despite Promising Courses Would Be Available in 2021","Instead Athletics and Recreation has posted [this announcement](https://recreation.ucsc.edu/news/scuba-update-w22.html) claiming that classes are unable to be offered due to ""the Covid-19 pandemic...human resource processes, supply chain logistics, dive locker inspection approvals, and required staff certifications"".

Athletics and Recreation Director Sue Harriman [asserted in Dec 2020 after announcing the layoffs](https://www.cityonahillpress.com/2020/12/10/recreational-and-p-e-instructors-face-permanent-layoffs/) ""SCUBA...and other recreational programs will not be cut and will continue to be offered in the coming academic year.""

In addition ""even with permanent staff layoffs, students will continue to pay fees associated with P.E. and recreation through Measures 32 and 64. Students pay a total of $12.50 per quarter in fees toward instruction and salaries."", so students are still paying for these courses which are no longer available. 

In the Spring Announcement the Athletics and Recreation Department states that ""local dive shops have been notified so they can prepare instruction for UCSC students with special consideration of your schedules and personal financial situations."" however before the layoffs UCSC offered SCUBA courses to students for free as a part of the above mentioned Measures.

Why are the programs you're still paying for unavailable? UCSC had one of the best scuba instruction programs in the state and now has no program, instead is forcing students to pay for outside instruction.",1.0,1.0

67,UCSC,The classes I took for my Computer Science B.S. degree at UC Santa Cruz,"I transferred to UCSC in Fall 2020 from a community college, so I'll only be giving my experience with the CSE(Computer Science and Engineering) upper division courses I took each quarter. Every class I took was also remote, but I think some people might find this useful still so I'll post it.

I want to post this for people who want to see what CSE upper division courses you'd take as a Computer Science student and hopefully answer some of your questions you might have about the Computer Science degree at UCSC.

This is my review about each class and professor. If you disagree with what I said, please be respectful.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fall 2020:**

|*Class*|*Professor Name*|*Rating of the Class*|*Required Course or Elective?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CSE101: Data Structures and Algorithms|Patrick Tantalo|10/10|Required|
|CSE120: Computer Architecture|Sagnik Nath|5/10|Required|

Patrick Tantalo was a really good professor. He explained all the material well and his assignments and quizzes weren't difficult at all. Workload was very manageable and I learned a lot from this class. The assignments are in C/C++. It's super important that you pick a good professor for CSE101 because that's where you learn data structures and algorithms, which will come up a lot during interviews. Highly recommend Tantalo.

This was Nath's first time teaching as a professor. He's a nice guy, but I found his lectures hard to understand and follow. His homework and exams were pretty hard at times, overall just wasn't a fun learning experience and felt this class wasn't too useful for me. Try to avoid him, but if you have to take him for CSE120, just make sure you really pay attention during lectures and attend TA office hours.

&amp;#x200B;

**Winter 2021:**

|*Class*|*Professor Name*|*Rating of the Class*|*Required Course or Elective?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CSE102: Intro to Analysis of Algorithms|David Martin|7/10|Required|
|CSE112: Comparative Programming Languages|Wesley Mackey|3/10|Required|

Martin was often unprepared to lectures and the grading of the assignments and exams were pretty harsh. I don't recommend taking him as a professor. The reason why I rate this class high was because of how useful it was. I learned a lot of new topics that would come up during interviews.

CSE112 with Mackey was boring and useless. You learn 4-5 new programming languages that you'll never use again. His lectures were boring and the assignments were pretty tough. Exams were pretty easy remotely, but I think if I took it in-person, it'd be a much harder course. Don't recommend taking any classes with Mackey in general.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spring 2021:**

|*Class*|*Professor Name*|*Rating of the Class*|*Required Course or Elective?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CSE144: Applied Machine Learning|CiHang Xie|4/10|Elective|
|CSE111: Advanced Programming|Wesley Mackey|4/10|Elective|
|STATS131: Intro to Probability Theory|David Draper|7/10|Required|

Xie's lectures and assignments were hard to understand. Lectures were kinda all over the place and the assignments were confusing. The quizzes weren't as bad, just need to look at the lecture slides. You do learn some ML topics and you code in Python. I'm not really interested in Machine Learning so I felt this class was useless for me, but if you are interested in learning ML, take CSE144 with another professor.

Mackey's CSE111 is similar to his CSE112 course, except the assignments are in C++. I only took it because there weren't any other classes open. Don't recommend taking unless you know nothing about C++ and want to learn it badly.

Draper is an easy A. He gives out the answers to all of the assignments and quizzes in his office hours so make sure to attend those. I felt the information I learned in this course was pretty useless because I don't want to do anything related to statistics at all. Might be useful for you if you plan to go into AI/ML.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summer 2021:**

|*Class*|*Professor Name*|*Rating of the Class*|*Required Course or Elective Course?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CSE183: Web Applications (changed to CSE186: Full Stack Web Development I)|David Harrison|10/10|Elective|

This was the best and most useful course I've taken here at UCSC. Harrison is a really good professor and his lectures and assignments are super clear. His exams aren't too bad as long as you pay attention during lectures and read his slides to study. I learned about many modern technologies (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL) that lots of companies use and became such a better programmer by the end of this course. This class will introduce you to web development. If you're interested in learning about it, take this class with this professor. This class was pretty difficult and time consuming, but it was worth it in the end. This course helped me land a job. HIGHLY RECOMMEND taking this course with David Harrison.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fall 2021:**

|*Class*|*Professor Name*|*Rating of the Class*|*Required Course or Elective Course?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CSE130: Principles of Computer Systems Design|Peter Alvaro|5/10|Required|
|CSE103: Computational Models|Delbert Bailey|4/10|Required|
|CSE115A: Intro to Software Engineering|Richard Jullig|9/10|Required|

Alvaro's CSE130 course was disorganized and difficult. Lectures were hard to follow at times. His exams were graded super harshly. The programming assignments were really difficult and confusing. Every programming assignment was in C. The information I learned in this class was pretty useful at least. I don't recommend Alvaro at all, take CSE130 with someone else. CSE130 is considered the hardest CSE upper division course so it's super important you take it with a really good professor.

Bailey's CSE103 lectures were pretty boring and his homework assignments weren't too hard. The exams take up most of the grade. 10% of the grade is homework and 90% of your grade is the 3 exams. You might have to take it with Bailey because there aren't too many other professors teaching CSE103 so I recommend attending office hours and paying attention during lectures. If you can, try to take it with a different professor.

I highly recommend taking CSE115A. You learn about Scrum and Agile methodologies, which many software engineers in the industry use. You also work on a project in a team throughout the whole quarter, which you can put on your resume. The projects can be almost anything you want. The class itself was super chill. The reading assignments and quizzes were easy. HIGHLY RECOMMEND taking this class, especially in the Fall quarter(I'll mention why down below).

&amp;#x200B;

**Winter 2022:**

|*Class*|*Professor Name*|*Rating of the Class*|*Required Course or Elective Course?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CSE115B: Software Design Project|Richard Jullig|10/10|Elective|
|CSE160: Intro to Computer Graphics|James Davis|9/10|Elective|

CSE115B is the continuation after CSE115A. You can only take CSE115B in the winter quarter and must complete CSE115A before taking it. In this class, you work on a project that is sponsored by an outside company. This year, there were many companies like Databricks, Dell, Keysight that sponsored projects that the students could work on. It's a really fun and useful class. There are no lectures or exams, just work on the project. It's really good to put on your resume as well. HIGHLY recommend taking this course.

CSE160 with Davis was really chill and fun. The exams weren't too difficult as long as you attended lectures. The assignments were pretty fun. I learned a lot about computer graphics as well. Overall a good class where you learn and aren't stressed out. I recommend taking it as a fun course.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spring 2022:**

|*Class*|*Professor Name*|*Rating of the Class*|*Required Course or Elective Course?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CSE115C: Software Design Project II|Richard Jullig|10/10|Elective|

CSE115C is the continuation of CSE115B. CSE115C is only offered in the Spring quarter and you must have taken CSE115B in the previous Winter quarter. You continue to work on the company-sponsored project you picked in CSE115B. CSE115B/C is similar to an internship, where you work on a project with that company and they'll help you out whenever you need help. I STRONGLY recommend taking the whole CSE115A/B/C series so you can put the projects on your resume and learn a ton of new technologies. The whole CSE115A/B/C series super chill and fun.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Thoughts:**

Overall, I felt most of these classes prepared me well for the industry. UCSC has a lot of different electives for you to choose from. There are many classes that go over topics like AI/ML, Computer Graphics, Distributed Systems, Computer Networks, Databases, and Full Stack Development.

Don't take my experiences and thoughts as facts, this is just only my opinion. In the end, your college education is what you make of it. This degree was tough so make sure you study hard and grind. I'm open to answering any questions you might have. Thank you for reading this far",0.98,115.0
68,UCSC,my ass just got saved in cse111,"as much as I feel sorry for Mackey‚Äôs illness and wish him a fast recovery, i‚Äôm glad that Harrison took over the class. I was not doing so hot in the first two assignments and was lowkey not hoping to pass the class. I didn‚Äôt know much C++ and literally got thrown into coding these big bois like simulated shell and calculator. Mackey‚Äôs teaching style was certainly not helping, where he just read his codes line by line. I am certainly liking Harrison‚Äôs teaching style much better.

91,UCSC,Seats available in upper/lower division CS courses at UC Berkeley for UCSC students,"UC Berkeley summer session has a lot of classes which simultaneously support both in-person and fully remote students.

One upper division CS class(COMPSCI 161) is surely taking all students who apply. The professor taking CS161 confirmed that everyone on the waitlist will be taken.

Also during summer they do not enforce pre-requisites.

If you attend any UC campus , you get the same discounted UC course fee at UC Berkeley.

Remote Support

*CS 10: The class will be taught primarily IN-PERSON with some remote options.*

*CS 61A: Remote attendance options will be provided for lecture, discussion, and lab. Exams will be administered in-person, with remote accommodations provided on an as-needed basis. Explicit support will not be made for students taking the course from a non-Pacific timezone. More details will be made available as we continue planning*

*CS 61BL: Fully-remote students supported*

*CS 61C: Fully-remote students supported*

*CS 70: The class will be taught primarily IN-PERSON with few remote options. (from class guide)*

GPA from UC Berkeley summer courses will be counted in your overall GPA of UCSC with the annotation that it was taken at Berkeley.

For some courses you might have to file a petition form with CS department by filling in the form below

[https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/current-students/policies-forms-petitions](https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/current-students/policies-forms-petitions)

**With the above process there is always a risk they might just give you unit credit and not subject credit. Also as per CS department it is best to get a pre-approval of the course whether it will be approved.** Wait times for this is about 4 weeks. Petition for CS161 is already filed to see if it can used as a capstone elective for CS, awaiting approval. So if someone else is taking CS161, approval might be faster.

Process to enroll is very simple for UC students across any campus(incl UCSC).

Just go to [summer.berkeley.edu](https://summer.berkeley.edu) and be sure to enroll as a UC campus student to get the discounted rate. You will need to give a photo of student id , or in case of newly admitted freshman/transfer you can give a screenshot of your signed SIR as a proof of being a UC student.",0.57,2.0
